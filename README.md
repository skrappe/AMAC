# Bachelor - Automatic Monitoring And Control

## 📌 Introduktion
The labs at the IT University (ITU) in Copenhagen support a wide range of activities, from student coursework to research and prototyping. They house diverse resources such as tools, electronic components, and other shared equipment. However, managing these resources is a significant challenge, as items are often misplaced or depleted without notice.

To address these challenges, we propose the development of a **"keep order system"** for ITU’s lab spaces. This system will integrate embedded hardware and software to track resources, notify supervisors when supplies need replenishing, and provide a real-time overview of lab resources. 

## ❌ Problemformulering
ITU’s lab spaces currently rely on manual or ad-hoc methods to manage shared resources, leading to several inefficiencies:

### 🔴 **1. Resource Misplacement and Depletion**
- **Misplacement:** Tools and components are easily lost, disrupting academic work.
- **Depletion:** Consumables (e.g., electronic parts) may run out unexpectedly, causing delays in coursework and research.

### 🔴 **2. Equipment Tracking and Maintenance**
- **Unscheduled Downtime:** Equipment failures are only noticed when they disrupt student projects or research.
- **Reactive Maintenance:** Problems are often addressed too late, leading to inefficiencies and higher costs.

A structured system is needed to improve **resource tracking, efficiency, and lab operations at ITU**.

## 🛠 **Metodologi**
We will develop the system using an iterative approach:

### **📖 1. Research & Requirement Gathering**
- 📚 **Literature Review:** Investigate existing lab-management tools.
- 🎤 **Stakeholder Interviews:** Gather insights from ITU lab staff and students.
- 🎯 **Problem Refinement:** Prioritize features based on findings.

### **📝 2. Conceptual Design & Prototyping**
- 🔧 **System Architecture Draft:** Develop a high-level design for tracking.
- 🏗 **Prototyping:** Create a proof-of-concept.
- 🔄 **Iterative Feedback:** Incorporate input from ITU stakeholders.

### **🖥️ 3. Implementation & Integration**
- 🏗 **Modular Development:** Incrementally build the system.
- 🔌 **Hardware Integration:** Ensure reliable communication between hardware and software.
- 👥 **Collaboration:** Use GitHub for version control.

### **✅ 4. Testing & Evaluation**
- 🏫 **User Trials:** Conduct testing in the ITU lab.
- 🔄 **Refinement:** Improve usability based on feedback.
- 📑 **Documentation:** Create guides for system setup and maintenance.
